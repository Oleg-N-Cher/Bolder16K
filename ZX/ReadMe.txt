This small clone of Boulder Dash has
several distinctive features here
from the original game, making
the playing less arcade-like and
more like a puzzle game.

You can push several stones at once,
if there are no diamonds in the chain.
You can also push a stone up.

The game has small mazes and
no scrolling, limited number of objects.
The goal is: collect all the diamonds and
do not get caught by the monsters!

Don't look for the fire button, not here!
You can only kill monsters by dropping
something on them.

I express my gratitude to all the people
involved of the Concurso juegos ASM 2021.

The title screen saver was drawn by
several people at once:

  Ekaterina Borisova,
  Saveliy Ivankov,
  Svetlana Golichenko,
  Yulia Golichenko,
  ...and me :)
